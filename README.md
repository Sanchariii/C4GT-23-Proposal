# C4GT'23-Proposal

# Synopsis

In today's technological environment, AI tools have become crucial. These tools make use of machine learning and artificial intelligence to improve decision-making, automate tasks, and draw conclusions from data. AI technologies provide a wide range of functions that streamline complex operations and spur innovation across industries, from natural language processing to computer vision. Machines are now capable of comprehending, analysing, and producing human language thanks to Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. They make text classification, sentiment analysis, and language translation easier.

The proposed idea leverages Python, CLI, Natural Language Processing (NLP), System Design, Data Hugging Transformers , FastAPI, UVicorn technologies to enable the development of an asynchronous Document Embedding Uploader API. AsyncDocEmbed is a  cutting-edge project that seeks to transform document embedding and sharing. It offers a simple API for uploading files, creating asynchronous embeddings for document chunks, and allowing users to download the entire file whenever they want. Hugging Face Transformers and NLP approaches are combined to give AsyncDocEmbed users the ability to extract valuable representations from their documents and apply them to a variety of applications. Proposed implementation details and Scalable High-Level system Designs (HLDs) have been discussed in the proposal.

The asynchronous nature of uploading and processing document chunks underlies the project's main functionality. The API allows users to quickly upload document chunks, and safe temporary storage of the data is provided. The Hugging Face Transformers library is then used to process the uploaded chunks using cutting-edge NLP techniques like tokenization and embedding creation. By capturing the semantic meaning and context of the document chunks, these embeddings enable users to get insightful information and carry out sophisticated research.
